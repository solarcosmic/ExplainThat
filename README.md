## How does ExplainThat work?
ExplainThat uses an AI API provided by Hack Club, which receives the information and attempts to explain it.

## How can I install ExplainThat?
Assuming you're using a Chrome-based browser:

- Go to `chrome://extensions`
- Check "Developer mode"
- Click on "Load unpacked"
